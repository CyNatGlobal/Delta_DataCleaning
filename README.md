# Data Processing and Cleaning Script

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Python script designed for processing and cleaning a large CSV dataset, potentially containing user information.

## Functionality

The script performs the following operations:

1. **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `os`, and `logging`.

2. **Load CSV:** Loads a large CSV file using `pd.read_csv`.

3. **Split CSV:** Divides the large CSV into smaller, more manageable chunks for easier processing.
   - Function `split_csv()` handles this operation.

4. **Process Individual Chunks:** Iterates through each created chunk and cleanses the data.
   - Renames Columns: Renames columns to improve consistency and clarity.
   - Save Cleaned Chunk: Saves the cleaned chunk to a new CSV.

5. **Garbage Data Identification:** Identifies rows containing potentially problematic data that might need further investigation.
   - Missing Columns: Checks for missing critical columns.
   - Invalid Email Formats: Validates email addresses using a regular expression.
   - Invalid Birthdays: Validates birthdays to ensure they are in a correct format.
   - Duplicates: Identifies and saves duplicate rows.

6. **Logging:** Logs all cleaning operations and their results to a log file named 'garbage_data_log.txt'.

7. **Saving Garbage Data:** Saves all invalid or duplicate rows to a separate CSV file named 'garbage_data.csv'.
